                        Due to the 100% customized hand-made nature of all the artworks I paint for Fluffy.co.il, I cannot offer returns. Your artwork is hand painted with care and is entirely personal to you and your pet.

                        If you received an incorrect or damaged artwork, let me know and I'll send out a replacement as fast as possible! Note that while I do not refund faulty orders, I do replace them as quickly as I can.

                        If you have placed an order recently and have changed your mind, you can cancel your order within 12 hours. Any cancellation request sent after this 12 hour window will be accepted at my discretion. If accepted, you will be subject to a 30% cancellation fee. This is because I will have already spent time working on your artwork by this point.

                        Please be aware that when I create your artwork, I use the photo you uploaded with your order. If you do not follow my Photo Guide, I cannot offer any solution. It's your responsibility to submit a high quality photo that adheres to my submission guidelines. Low quality photos may result in low quality artwork. I do allow for notes to be added to orders in case you have anything to let me know about. However, I can't guarantee that special requests will be adhered to - for example I cannot edit a photo to close or open a mouth, add a smile etc. I can however, remove red eye, edit eye color and other requests by my consideration.
