            <ul>
                  <li>Make sure the photo is taken in good lighting (outdoor daylight is best)</li>
                  <li>Try to take the photo at eye level with your pet</li>
                  <li>Try to get a close up so I can see your pet's unique features
                        <ul>
                              <li>Choose photo with exact position of your pet you wanna have on artwork</li>
